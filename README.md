# Utility Network Rules Verifier

**A comprehensive tool designed to optimize utility network management by addressing customization challenges and supporting continuous improvement.**

## Introduction

Migrating to the ArcGIS Utility Network often presents challenges in adapting Esri’s standard utility network rules to meet specific operational needs. Key challenges include:

- **Asset Rules Not Applicable**: Standard rules may not fit the company's unique operations.
- **Missing Equipment**: Standard configurations might not include all the equipment the company uses.
- **Nomenclature Mismatches**: Discrepancies between company-specific terminology and Esri’s standards can lead to confusion and errors.

These challenges can result in inefficiencies and inaccuracies. Our Utility Network Rules Verifier offers a robust solution to address these issues.

## Key Features

### 1. Customizable Rule Management

- **Tailored Rule Verification**: Customize and verify network rules to align with your specific asset management needs, ensuring relevance and accuracy.
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrates smoothly with your existing ArcGIS Utility Network setup, enhancing rule management without disrupting current workflows.

### 2. Continuous Improvement Support

- **Dynamic Rule Updates**: Refine and add new rules as your operations evolve, ensuring ongoing accuracy and efficiency of the network.
- **Automated Notifications**: Receive timely alerts for new rules or updates required based on operational changes.

### 3. Enhanced Collaboration

- **ArcGIS Survey123 Integration**: Provides a user-friendly interface for field crews and non-GIS professionals to specify asset parameters and rules.
- **Streamlined Information Sharing**: Share updates and rule changes effortlessly across teams through a simple link, ensuring everyone has the latest data.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Custom rules minimize the risk of irrelevant or incorrect configurations.
- **Increased Efficiency**: Automation and continuous improvement features reduce manual errors and outdated practices, saving time and resources.
- **Broader Accessibility**: Enables non-GIS professionals to manage and verify rules effectively, making the tool accessible to all team members.

## How It Works

1. **Define Parameters**: Specify asset parameters, such as asset groups and types, using an xlsForm within ArcGIS Survey123.
2. **Data Extraction**: JavaScript extracts and verifies data from CSV files containing utility network rules.
3. **Rule Verification**: The tool cross-checks data against customized rules, flagging inconsistencies or missing equipment.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular updates and refinements ensure the rules stay aligned with evolving company needs.
