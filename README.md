# Utility Network Rules Verifier

Empowering non-GIS professionals to verify and customize utility network rules.

## Introduction

In the utility sector, experts such as field crews, designers etc.. often lack the tools to efficiently verify and customize utility network rules. Our project bridges this gap by developing a user-friendly solution that empowers non-GIS professionals to perform these tasks with ease.

## Key Features

### User-Friendly Interface with ArcGIS Survey123

Our solution leverages the power of ArcGIS Survey123, a versatile data collection app. By integrating an xlsForm within ArcGIS Survey123, users can specify asset parameters such as asset group and asset types without needing extensive GIS knowledge.

### Automated Data Extraction with JavaScript

Using JavaScript, our system automatically extracts relevant data from a CSV file containing utility network rules. This automation ensures that users always have access to the most up-to-date information, reducing manual errors and saving time.

### Streamlined Collaboration

Information sharing within the organization is streamlined through a simple link, facilitating seamless collaboration. This feature enhances communication and coordination among team members, ensuring that everyone has access to the same data and insights.

## Benefits

- **Empowerment of Non-GIS Professionals**: Enables field crews and designers to verify and customize utility network rules without needing specialized GIS training.
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Automated data extraction reduces the likelihood of manual errors.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Easy sharing of information promotes better teamwork and decision-making.

## How It Works

1. **Define Parameters**: Users specify asset parameters such as asset group and asset types using an xlsForm within ArcGIS Survey123.
2. **Data Extraction**: JavaScript code extracts relevant data from a CSV file containing utility network rules.
3. **Share Information**: A simple link allows for seamless sharing of the extracted information within the organization.

## Upcoming Presentation

We are excited to announce that this project will be presented at the **URISA Conference** in October 2024. The presentation will cover the development process, key features, and real-world applications of our solution. We invite you to join us to learn more and discuss how this tool can benefit the utility sector.

## Community Engagement
