# Search inconsistent Utility Network Rules
In a utility network, network rules dictate which features can connect to or associate with other types of features. The primary objective of this project was to develop an XLSform using ArcGIS Survey 123 to validate the connection rules within the Utility Network topology for pipeline infrastructure. This tool allows users to specify two pipeline types they wish to connect and then generates a list of all allowable connections for those pipes
