## Utility Network Rules Validation Form

A comprehensive tool designed to customize utility network Rules, supporting continuous improvement for utility systems such as electricity, gas, water, stormwater, wastewater, and telecommunications.

### Introduction
Migrating to the ArcGIS Utility Network presents challenges in adapting Esri’s standard utility network rules to specific operational needs. Key challenges include:

- **Asset Rules Not Applicable**: Standard rules may not suit the company's unique operations.
- **Missing Equipment**: Predefined configurations may omit critical equipment.
- **Nomenclature Mismatches**: Differences between company-specific terminology and Esri’s standards can create confusion.


### Key Features

#### Customizable Rule Management
- **Tailored Rule Verification**: Customize and verify network rules to align with specific asset management needs.

#### Continuous Improvement Support
- **Dynamic Rule Updates**: Add and refine rules as operations evolve, ensuring ongoing accuracy.
- **Notifications**: Receive alerts for required rule updates.

#### Enhanced Collaboration
- **ArcGIS Survey123 Integration**: Offers a user-friendly interface for non-GIS professionals to manage asset rules.
- **Streamlined Information Sharing**: Share updates and rule changes across teams with ease.


### How It Works
1. **Define Parameters**: Specify asset details using an xlsForm in ArcGIS Survey123.
2. **Data Extraction**: JavaScript verifies data from CSV files containing utility network rules.
3. **Rule Verification**: The tool cross-checks data, highlighting inconsistencies.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular updates ensure evolving company needs are met.
