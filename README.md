# Utility Network Rules Verifier

A tool for enhancing utility network management by addressing challenges in rule customization and promoting continuous improvement.

## Introduction

When companies migrate to the ArcGIS Utility Network, they often face challenges in customizing Esriâ€™s standard utility network rules to fit their specific needs. Common issues include:

- **Asset Rules Not Applicable**: Companies may encounter asset rules that do not align with their specific operations.
- **Missing Equipment**: Esri's standard configurations might lack certain equipment that the company uses.
- **Nomenclature Mismatches**: Differences between the company's terminology and Esri's Utility Network standards can create confusion and errors.

These challenges can lead to inefficiencies, inaccuracies, and management difficulties. Our Utility Network Rules Verifier addresses these issues by providing a comprehensive solution.

## Key Features

### 1. Customizable Rule Management

- **Tailored Rule Verification**: Our tool allows companies to customize and verify network rules to match their unique asset management needs, ensuring that only relevant rules are applied.
- **Integration with Existing Systems**: Easily integrates with your current ArcGIS Utility Network setup to enhance rule management without disrupting existing workflows.

### 2. Continuous Improvement Support

- **Dynamic Rule Updates**: Companies can continuously refine and add new rules to the Utility Network as their operations evolve, ensuring the network remains accurate and efficient.
- **Automated Notifications**: Receive alerts when new rules are available or when existing rules need updates based on operational changes.

### 3. Enhanced Collaboration

- **ArcGIS Survey123 Integration**: Empowers field crews and non-GIS professionals to specify asset parameters and rules using a simple, user-friendly interface in ArcGIS Survey123.
- **Streamlined Information Sharing**: Share updates and rule changes across teams via a simple link, ensuring everyone has access to the most current data.

## Benefits

- **Improved Accuracy**: Tailored rules reduce the likelihood of applying irrelevant or incorrect configurations.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automation and continuous improvement features save time and resources by minimizing manual errors and outdated practices.
- **Empowerment of Non-GIS Professionals**: Field crews and designers can manage and verify rules without needing specialized GIS training, making the tool accessible to all team members.

## How It Works

1. **Define Parameters**: Users specify asset parameters such as asset group and asset types using an xlsForm within ArcGIS Survey123.
2. **Data Extraction**: JavaScript code automatically extracts and verifies data from CSV files containing utility network rules.
3. **Rule Verification**: The tool checks the data against the customized rules, flagging any inconsistencies or missing equipment.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update and refine rules to match the evolving needs of the company.
